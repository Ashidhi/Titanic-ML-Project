# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This is a Machine Learning project where I predict passenger survival on the Titanic using historical data from the [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).

## 📊 Dataset Used

* **train.csv** – Training data with survival outcomes.
* **test.csv** – Test data without survival labels (used for final predictions).
* Data includes features like:

  * Passenger class, age, sex, fare
  * Number of siblings/spouses aboard
  * Embarkation port, etc.

## 🔍 Project Overview

I applied end-to-end Data Science steps:

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building
5. Model Comparison (Logistic Regression vs. Random Forest)
6. Final Submission Predictions

## 🤖 Models Used

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Random Forest Classifier** (selected as final model based on performance)

## ✅ Final Results

* **Validation Accuracy**: \~82%
* **Kaggle Submission Score**: `0.74`

## 🔎 Key Insights

* **Sex, Fare, and Pclass** were the most important survival factors.
* Women and children had higher survival rates.
* Random Forest performed slightly better than Logistic Regression.
